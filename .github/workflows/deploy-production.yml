# .github/workflows/deploy.yml

# This workflow:
#
#   1. Triggers on pushes to the main branch or manual dispatch
#   2. Sets up a Node.js environment with pnpm
#   3. Implements dependency caching for faster builds
#   4. Builds the Astro site
#   5. Deploys the built files to BunnyCDN
#
# Setup Instructions:
#
# This workflow requires configuration of BunnyCDN-related secrets in the
# GitHub repository settings. Before using this workflow, please ensure you
# have created the following required secrets:
#
# - STORAGE_NAME: Your BunnyCDN storage zone name
# - STORAGE_DESTINATION: The directory within the storage zone (leave empty for root)
# - STORAGE_PASSWORD_RW: Your BunnyCDN storage zone password (for uploads)
# - STORAGE_KEY: Your BunnyCDN storage API key (for uploads)
# - PULL_ZONE_ID: Your BunnyCDN pull zone ID
# - BUNNY_API_KEY: Your BunnyCDN Account API key (for cache purging)
#
# If the project uses Sentry for error tracking, you'll also need to
# configure these additional secrets:
#
# - SENTRY_DSN: Your Sentry data source name
# - SENTRY_ORG: Your Sentry organization slug
# - SENTRY_PROJECT: Your Sentry project slug
# - SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: Your Sentry authentication token
#
# Ensure the repository has a main branch, or modify the workflow trigger
# to match the primary branch name.
#
# Once configured, the workflow will automatically build and deploy the
# site to BunnyCDN whenever you push to the main branch.
